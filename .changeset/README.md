# Changesets

Use `npm run changeset` for any user-facing change that affects the published
`@critiq/rules` package.

## File naming

Use **`yyyy-mm-dd-<slug>.md`** for every changeset file, where:

- `yyyy-mm-dd` is the date the changeset was authored (UTC).
- `<slug>` is a short, kebab-case description of the change.

Example: `2026-05-09-python-framework-catalog-rules.md`.

`npm run changeset` (the Changesets CLI) generates a random three-word filename
by default — **rename it** to the `yyyy-mm-dd-<slug>.md` form before committing.
Date-prefixed filenames keep `.changeset/` sortable by authoring order and make
it obvious at a glance which pending entries are stale.

## Changelog

`changelog` is enabled in `.changeset/config.json`. When you run
`npm run version:packages`, Changesets appends consumed entries to
`libs/rules/catalog/CHANGELOG.md`.

To rebuild historical CHANGELOG content from git history (one-time backfill):

```bash
node scripts/backfill-changelog.mjs
```
